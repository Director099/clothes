        p The cutting techniques are unique. A wealth of exclusive expertise, consolidated over the years by the experience of Vincenzo and Cesare Attolini. Each stage of stitching is followed by a stage of ironing, followed in turn by precise rest stages which vary according to the specific nature of the fabric. #[strong Ultra strict control stages], starting with checks upon receipt of the fabrics.

        p What follows is simply the story of some of the major stages in creating an authentic tailored jacket from the Neapolitan school. #[br] What makes each Cesare Attolini jacket unique are those #[strong little handcrafted details fine-tuned over the decades] by Vincenzo Attolini, needless to say, designer and creator of the #[strong first unstructured Neapolitan-style jacket], and perfected by his son Cesare. #[br] #[strong Secrets. Real, small, precious secrets. Details. Minute details]. Because the difference lies precisely in a series of manual gestures, of real, skilled handling of the fabrics, from the cutting stage to the ironing stages.
